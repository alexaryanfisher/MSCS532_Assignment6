# Selection Algorithms and Data Structures
### Medians and Order Statistics & Elementary Data Structures

This repository contains my sixth assignment for MSCS532. This is an Python implementation of fundamental data structures and selection algorithms.

## Project Overview
This project aims to show a comparsion of selection algorithms such as randomized and deterministic with the use of Quickselect and Median of Medians. It also demostrates the implementation of various elementary data structures such as arrays, matrices, stacks, queues, and linked lists.

 * ### Part 1: Selection Algorithms
      This part of the implementations highlights the randomized quickselect algorithm and deterministic selection with Median of Medians. This section also includes a performance comparsion between the two based on the empirical analysis of their running times.

 * ### Part 2: Data Structures
      This part of the project implements the use of an array, matrix, stack, queue, and linked list within Python. The code for this section includes use cases to demostrate their core operations.

## Project Deliverables:
```selection.py``` : Python file containing implementation of selection algorithms such as randomized quickselect and median of medians. 

```datastructures.py``` : Python file containing implementation of elementary data structions as well as their use cases.

```ProjectReport.md```: Report containing the analysis of selection algorithms to include their performance analysis and empirical analysis comparsion. It also contains data structures design choices, use cases, and performance comparison.

## Summary of Findings
[Pending]
